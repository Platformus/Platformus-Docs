Platformus CMS
==============

`Platformus <https://platformus.net/>`_ is free, open source, and cross-platform developer-friendly CMS
based on ASP.NET Core, `ExtCore framework <https://extcore.net/>`_, and `Magicalizer <https://magicalizer.net/>`_.

It can be used for rapid development of the websites and admin panels for mobile and web applications.
There are built-in features to describe, create, and deliver multilingual and multicultural content as HTML or JSON without writing code,
but it is possible to develop custom extensions with the standardized user interface when performance is important.
Wide range of the tag helpers makes it simpler and faster.

Platformus CMS is modular and extendable, it can run on different environments (Linux, Mac, Windows, and clouds)
and supports different database types (PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server).
