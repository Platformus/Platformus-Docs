Styles
======

You can manage (add, edit, and delete) your styles from the backend using the :guilabel:`Development/Styles` section:

It might be very useful, because you don’t need any special tool to provide quick changes.
There is the built-in simple code editor with the syntax highlighting:

Using the :guilabel:`Development/Bundles` section you can configure the bundles, so when you click the
:guilabel:`Save button` on the style create/edit page, all the styles from the bundles will be automatically
concatenated and minified, so you can save traffic and downloading time.
