Storage Scripts
===============

Currently Platformus supports following storage types:

* PostgreSQL database;
* SQLite database;
* SQL Server database;
* Azure SQL database (actually, it is almost the same as SQL Server one).

GitHub repository contains `SQL scripts <https://github.com/Platformus/Platformus>`_ for each storage type,
separately with the schema and initial data. You can also use installer to create ready to use storage for you
(even if you are not `using compiled executable <http://docs.platformus.net/en/latest/getting_started/use_as_compiled_executable.html>`_
but `using Platformus as NuGet packages <http://docs.platformus.net/en/latest/getting_started/use_as_nuget_packages.html>`_).
