Storage Scripts
===============

Currently Platformus supports following storage types:

* PostgreSQL database;
* SQLite database;
* SQL Server database;
* Azure SQL database (actually, it is almost the same as SQL Server one).

GitHub repository contains `SQL scripts <https://github.com/Platformus/Platformus>`_ for each storage type,
separately with the schema and initial data.
